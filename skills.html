		Although I am not a graduate student of computer science, I majored in Electronic Engineering which is also related to coding, so I am really familiar with coding when I was a student. And I started learning the knowledge of front-end earlier. Now, as an front-end developer, like other developers, I can use <strong>HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Angular JS </strong>to build an <strong><em>interactive and responsive </em></strong>web page with minimum code to realize users' requrements, giving users' better experience. </p>
		<p>
	    Keeping on learnig other front-end libraries is what I am doing. Also, I need an opportunity to work in a team, coorperate with the team members to learn from working and learn from each other.</p>
	    <p>
	    This web page is a lttle project doing by myself and I will keep on optimizing it if you are willing to leave you suggestions here and I will be very thankful for you. More and more web <a url="#">projects</a> will be finished and uploaded to the server in the future. Hope everyone's visiting!</p>

It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.</p>	</div>
